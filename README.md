# project2--Recognizing Chinese Calligraphy

I am currently participating in a competition.

**The background of the competition :**

*Without being exposed to some original calligraphy works younger generations may find it difficult to recognize the ancient calligraphy fonts. This may cause the traditions of calligraphy to fail to pass on. Therefore, using advanced technologies to accurately and automatically recognize calligraphy characters in real time is of great value to help pass on the art of calligraphy as well as the Chinese culture behind it.*

*With the aid of artificial intelligence (AI), we have achieved a high level of accuracy in recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially, in recognizing non-regular script calligraphy used in various real life scenarios (such as in national paintings or on the face of buildings). Through this contest, we hope to collect creative AI algorithms from you to help solve this problem.*

**Our idea**

Traditional fonts are arranged in an irregular order and in size, like horizontally or vertically.

Our idea : first use Mask RCNN training, and then....cut the image and send it to CRNN for training, and then...... test
